# Schedule-Assistsant-
An editable work day schedule 


## Description

The website is designed to be an editable work day planner.  The website utilyzes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to function.

The purpose of the Schedule Assistant is to provide a way for the user to organize their work day.

I built the website to continue practicing with Javascript and learning new elements of it with the assistance of JQUERY.

While creating the website I expanded my knowledge of Javascript as well as the JQUERY elements that were required to write the code.

## Installation
No installation required.


## Usage

The Schedule Assistant can be loaded via any browser.  Once the webpage is loaded the user can select a time of day from 8AM until 5PM.  When the user selects a time they then can type whatever information they'd like into the box.  After entering the data into the chosen time, the user should then save the data onto the local storage by clicking the disk button in the blue section on the right of each time box.  The data is then stored in the local storage so the user can refresh the page and the information is still on the website.

The website also has color coded blocks so the user knows the past times (grey), the current time (red), and the future times (green).
